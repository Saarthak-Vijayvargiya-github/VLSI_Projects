# VLSI Projects

This project work represents a partial completion of the EEE F313 Analog and Digital VLSI Design course instructed by [Dr. Anu Gupta](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/anu-gupta/), Professor at BITS Pilani, Rajasthan. The primary emphasis of the project is on designing low power digital circuits which can be further integrated to various IC designs.

## Problem Statement

For digital design project, we were just provided the problem and we were required to do following tasks:
- Formulate a verilog code for the design.
- Sketch the schematic using minimum logic gates in DSCH.
- Design the layout in Memsim and simulate it.
- Optimize the circuit for power consumption.

## What's Inside

The problem statement provided to us is shown below:
